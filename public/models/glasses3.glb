# Placeholder GLB Model File - Modern Style

This is a placeholder for the glasses3.glb model file (Modern style).
In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file containing the 3D modern glasses model.

For development purposes, the AR component will fall back to procedural geometry when GLB files are not available.

To add real GLB models:
1. Create or download 3D modern glasses models in GLB format
2. Replace this file with the actual binary GLB data
3. Ensure models are optimized for web (< 1MB recommended)
4. Test positioning and scaling with the AR component

Model Specifications for Modern Style:
- Contemporary rectangular or square frames
- Sleek, minimalist design
- Modern materials and finishes
- Suitable for professional/casual wear
