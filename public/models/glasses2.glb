# Placeholder GLB Model File - Aviator Style

This is a placeholder for the glasses2.glb model file (Aviator style).
In a real implementation, this would be a binary GLB file containing the 3D aviator glasses model.

For development purposes, the AR component will fall back to procedural geometry when GLB files are not available.

To add real GLB models:
1. Create or download 3D aviator glasses models in GLB format
2. Replace this file with the actual binary GLB data
3. Ensure models are optimized for web (< 1MB recommended)
4. Test positioning and scaling with the AR component

Model Specifications for Aviator Style:
- Teardrop-shaped lenses
- Thin metal frame
- Classic aviator proportions
- Realistic materials and textures
